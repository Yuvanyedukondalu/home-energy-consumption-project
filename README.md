# Home Energy Consumption Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts household energy consumption patterns using machine learning techniques. The model helps identify consumption patterns and predict future energy usage for better energy management.

## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Individual Household Electric Power Consumption
- **Records**: ~2 million measurements
- **Duration**: 47 months (December 2006 - November 2010)
- **Features**: Global active/reactive power, voltage, intensity, and sub-metering data
